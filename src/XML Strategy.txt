Strategy for handling XML settings file:

1. Generate the configuration name from Model/serial e.g. VX2740-22983 for serial
   number 22983 of a VX2740 module.
   
2. Create a default configuration from the <parameterDescriptor> keys.

3.  Create a new configuration for each <board>
   The connection iformation comes from the connection type, the IP address etc.
   Board parameter overrides come from <parameters><entry> tags.
   CHannel parameter overrides come from the <channel> tags.
   
We'll use the pugixml library as we did for the older boards but, for now,
bake it into the library we create.

On the whole we need a map of parameter names -> configuration item names.
Types as well:  per channel, board; we don't need data types because we can
tread all parameters as textual.  Per channels come from list indices.
